# Development Roadmap - Public Transports App

## Current Status

- âœ… Backend API serving personal journeys at `https://public-transports-back.fly.dev`
- âœ… Web app with "My Routes" functionality using Kubb + React Query
- âœ… React Native app with "Nearby Stops" (to be replaced)
- âœ… Testing strategy documented (2 tests per feature)

## Phase 1: Replace "Nearby Stops" with "My Routes" ðŸŽ¯

### Epic: Display Personal Routes

**Goal**: Replace current nearby stops functionality with personal saved routes from backend

#### User Story 1: Fetch and Display Routes

**As a** user  
**I want to** see my saved routes on the home screen  
**So that** I can quickly access my routine journeys

**Tasks:**

1. **Setup API Integration** (2-3 hours)
   - [ ] Install and configure Kubb for React Native
   - [ ] Generate API client from `https://public-transports-back.fly.dev/v3/api-docs`
   - [ ] Setup React Query in React Native app

2. **Domain Layer** (1-2 hours)
   - [ ] Create Journey entity (`src/domain/entities/Journey.ts`)
   - [ ] Create JourneyRepository interface (`src/domain/repositories/JourneyRepository.ts`)
   - [ ] Write Journey entity test âœ… (Testing Strategy: 1/2 tests)

3. **Infrastructure Layer** (1 hour)
   - [ ] Implement ApiJourneyRepository (`src/infrastructure/repositories/ApiJourneyRepository.ts`)
   - [ ] Create DTO mappers for API responses

4. **Application Layer** (30 mins)
   - [ ] Create useMyRoutes hook (`src/presentation/hooks/useMyRoutes.ts`)
   - [ ] Map domain entities to presentation models

5. **Presentation Layer** (2-3 hours)
   - [ ] Update home screen to use useMyRoutes instead of useNearbyStops
   - [ ] Create RouteCard component for displaying routes
   - [ ] Handle loading, error, and empty states
   - [ ] Write integration test âœ… (Testing Strategy: 2/2 tests)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Home screen shows personal routes instead of nearby stops
- [ ] Each route displays origin and destination
- [ ] Loading state while fetching routes
- [ ] Error handling for API failures
- [ ] Empty state when no routes exist

**Test Coverage:** 2 tests (1 domain, 1 integration)

#### User Story 2: Route Details Navigation

**As a** user  
**I want to** tap on a route to see transport options  
**So that** I can check arrival times for my journey

**Tasks:**

1. **Navigation Setup** (1 hour)
   - [ ] Setup navigation to route details screen
   - [ ] Pass route ID as navigation parameter

2. **Route Details Screen** (2-3 hours)
   - [ ] Create RouteDetailsScreen component
   - [ ] Fetch transport options for selected route
   - [ ] Display arrival times and platforms
   - [ ] Handle real-time updates if available

**Test Coverage:** 2 tests (1 navigation, 1 data fetching)

## Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience ðŸš€

### Epic: Improved Route Management

**Timeline**: After Phase 1 completion

#### User Story 3: Add New Route

**As a** user  
**I want to** add a new route  
**So that** I can save additional frequent journeys

#### User Story 4: Edit/Delete Routes

**As a** user  
**I want to** manage my existing routes  
**So that** I can keep my route list current

#### User Story 5: Route Favorites/Ordering

**As a** user  
**I want to** reorder or mark favorite routes  
**So that** my most used routes appear first

## Phase 3: Advanced Features ðŸ“±

### Epic: Smart Features

**Timeline**: Future consideration

#### User Story 6: Push Notifications

**As a** user  
**I want to** receive departure alerts  
**So that** I don't miss my transport

#### User Story 7: Offline Support

**As a** user  
**I want to** view my routes offline  
**So that** I can use the app without internet

#### User Story 8: Route Analytics

**As a** user  
**I want to** see my usage patterns  
**So that** I can optimize my routes

## Technical Milestones

### Milestone 1: API Integration Complete

- [ ] Kubb generating TypeScript types
- [ ] React Query managing data state
- [ ] Error boundaries handling failures
- [ ] Loading states throughout app

### Milestone 2: Feature Parity with Web App

- [ ] All web app routes functionality available
- [ ] Consistent data models between platforms
- [ ] Shared API contracts working correctly

### Milestone 3: Native Mobile Experience

- [ ] Touch-optimized UI components
- [ ] Platform-appropriate navigation patterns
- [ ] Performance optimized for mobile

## Development Principles

### Testing Strategy (Per TESTING-STRATEGY.md)

- **2 tests per user story** (1 domain, 1 integration)
- Focus on critical path and business logic
- Manual testing for UI/UX validation
- Increase coverage when patterns stabilize

### Architecture Guidelines (Per CLAUDE.md)

- Clean Architecture with DDD
- Domain layer independence
- Repository pattern for data access
- TypeScript strict mode throughout

### Code Quality

- ESLint + TypeScript compiler before commits
- Consistent formatting and naming
- Functional components with hooks
- Async/await over promises

## Timeline Estimates

### Phase 1 (Priority 1): 1-2 weeks

- **Week 1**: API setup + Domain/Infrastructure layers
- **Week 2**: Presentation layer + testing + polish

### Phase 2 (Priority 2): 2-3 weeks

- Enhanced CRUD operations for routes
- Improved UX and navigation

### Phase 3 (Priority 3): Future

- Advanced features based on usage feedback
- Performance optimizations
- Platform-specific enhancements

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria

- [ ] App launches and displays personal routes
- [ ] Navigation to route details works
- [ ] No crashes or major bugs
- [ ] Tests pass consistently
- [ ] Performance acceptable on device

### Learning Objectives (React Native)

- [ ] Understanding React Native project structure
- [ ] Working with React Query for state management
- [ ] Navigation patterns in React Native
- [ ] Platform differences (iOS vs Android)
- [ ] Testing React Native components

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

- **API Integration Complexity**: Mitigate with incremental implementation
- **React Native Learning Curve**: Leverage existing React knowledge
- **Device Testing**: Test on multiple devices early

### Project Risks

- **Scope Creep**: Stick to 2 tests per feature rule
- **Over-Engineering**: Remember this is a learning project
- **Time Investment**: Focus on Phase 1, defer advanced features

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Today**: Setup Kubb configuration in React Native project
2. **This Week**: Complete User Story 1 implementation
3. **Next Week**: User Story 2 + testing + polish

## Notes

- This roadmap follows our pragmatic testing approach (TESTING-STRATEGY.md)
- Architecture aligns with Clean Architecture guidelines (CLAUDE.md)
- Project vision documented in PROJECT-VISION.md
- Focus on learning React Native while building useful functionality
- Each phase can be evaluated independently for continuation
